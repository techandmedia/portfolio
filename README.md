This is my projects compilation in a single repo. Most of them are created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you want to check out one of them, simply do the following:
1. `git clone https://github.com/techandmedia/portfolio.git` 
2. `git checkout one-of-the-branch`
3. `cd` into that directory
4. `npm install` or `yarn`
5. `npm start` or `yarn start`
6. The app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Enjoy!

Regards,
Andri
